# refractainstaller 9.0.5
# Use this file ONLY if you're creating a separate /home or /boot partition
# AND you need to exclude any files or directories inside /home or /boot from
# being copied by rsync.

# This may not work, because the root of the transfer is /home/
#- /home/*/.gvfs
# Instead, you could put your user directory first, like this
#- user/.gvfs
# or maybe
#- fred/.gvfs
# For any other user name, I think the star will work. It should also
# affect multiple users this way:

- *.gvfs
- *.Xauthority
- *.ICEauthority
- *.xsession-errors*
